At the end of this Lesson:
1. I can solve absolute value equations
2. I can write, solve, graph, and write solutions to absolute value inequalities using interval notation
absolute value: the distance a value is from zero
distance can never be negative

"definition" of absolute value: |x| = a means x=a OR x=-a

Solving an absolute value equation 
1) Solve for the absolute value
2) Apply the definition of absolute value
3) Solve the remaining equations
4) Check for extraneous solutions

Extraneous Solutions: Solutions that are found that do not satisfy the given equation.

Remember to check by plugging in numbers to check
Remember to pay attention to detail in algebra II
Examples 
1) What is the solution of |2x+5|=9
Because it has an "=" sign it is an absolute equation
Two "|s" two equations
2x+5=9
2x=4
x=2
Check=ok
2x+5=-9
2x=-14
x=-7
Check=ok

2) What is the solution of 1/3|3x-6|-2=5?
1/3|3x-6|=7
------------
      3
|3x-6|=21

3x-6=21
3x=27
x=9
check=ok
3x-6=-21
3x=-15
x=-5
check=ok

3) What is the solution of |5x-2|=7x+14
since absolute value is on the left it can be solved for absolute value
5x-2=7x+14
-2x-2=14
-2x=16
x=-8
check=no
Extraneous
because variable is on the right that side will change
DO NOT check variable until you have both of them
5x-2=-7x-14
12x-2=-14
12x=-12
x=-1
check=ok
two answers because two sticks
If there are constants on the right, it has two solutions
If there are variables on both sides it is one or no answers
4) What is the solution of |-2x+9|=3x+10?
-2x+9=3x+10
directly to def
-2x+9=-3x-10
extraneous
-2x+9=3x+10
x=-1/5

Solving Absolute Value Inequalities
1)Solve for the absolute value
